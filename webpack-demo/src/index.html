  There are problems with managing JavaScript projects this way:

  - It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.
  - If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application will not function properly.
  - If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to download unnecessary code.-->
